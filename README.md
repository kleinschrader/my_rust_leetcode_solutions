## This is personal collection of my rust leetcode solutions.

Whenever i get the time or motivation to do a leetcode problem i will add them into [examples](/examples/) directory.
This is mainly so i can keep a central repository of all my solutions.

To test/run any solution just use the following command:

```
cargo test --example $number_of_leetcode_problem
```
